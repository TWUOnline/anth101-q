## Overview {-}

***Welcome to ANTH 101!***

> Anthropology is the study of all humans in all times in all places” (Wesch, 2017).

I have chosen two textbooks for this course. One that introduces you to a wide range of topics through a systematic, descriptive approach. However, you will notice that we do not cover all topics nor all chapters – there simply are too many. I have selected instead, the most common topics that will expose you to how contemporary people across the world live their lives differently than how you live yours. That textbook, called ***Perspectives,*** fittingly has numerous authors for the different chapters. However, I will refer to this resource as ***Perspectives*** rather than by the individual names of authors for each chapter.
<!--
If we want learners to cite properly, we need to model the same.

The second textbook called ***The Art of Being Human*** is limited in scope and topics, but it takes you on a journey of discovery. The author, Michael Wesch, asks questions, and challenges you to find answers. He is masterful in working with core themes, which he presents as videos and challenges for you to do yourself. The New York Times recognized Wesch as an innovative teacher who “give(s) students an experience that might change how they think, what they care about or even how they live their lives" (p. 359).

Here are a couple of quotes that introduce you to the experience you are about to have through this course:

> Anthropology is not only the science of human beings, but also the art of asking questions, making connections, and trying new things” (p. 5).

> You will have to overcome your fears, step outside your comfort zone, and get comfortable with the uncomfortable” (p. 5).

> … my willingness to change myself might be simultaneously the ONLY and BEST thing I can offer the world … “ (p. 353).

Wesch talks about being stretched himself – and he challenges you to be stretched – and become a healthy and responsible individual who can create a healthy and responsible society. If each of us does that, we collectively can create a healthier more inclusive and humane world. The fundamental experience of this textbook and the challenges through ***The Art of Being Human,*** is summarized this way:

>“You cannot just think your way into a new way of living. You have to live your way into a new way of thinking” (p. 6).

## What is Anthropology?

We begin our study by introducing the discipline of anthropology. Anthropology is an attempt to systematically study and document cultural differences. This course is solely a study of one sub-field: cultural anthropology. We will not study the other sub-fields which are archaeology, biological anthropology and linguistic anthropology. All four sub-fields are “applied” meaning that applied anthropologists span the subfields and use anthropological methods, and findings to solve practical problems in public and private sectors such as business and health.

## Anthropological Perspectives and Problem-Solving

Anthropology is unique from other social sciences, like psychology and sociology, in that anthropological perspectives involve four features:

- Holism  
- Relativism  
- Comparison  
- Fieldwork  

Because of its focus on differing and shifting perspectives, the study of anthropology enables students to think their way to another way of relating and living, and therefore “the anthropological perspective is an essential skill for nearly any career in today’s globalized world” (p. 17).

The *Perspectives* textbook introduces you briefly to the dual perspectives of anthropology being both scientific and humanistic (see p. 17). It is a science in its systematic approach. It is an art in that individuals are unique in their experience of their humanity. Michael Wesch, the author of your second textbook, shares “what the science of human beings can tell us about the art of being human.”

### Activity Learning {-}

::: {.callout-note}

#### Personal Reflection  {-}

To build upon the first reading, this article offers additional context around the importance of anthropology:

#### Read: [**Art of Being Human- Introduction**](assets/unit1/ArtOfBeingHuman2017Intro.pdf) {-}

#### Reflect {-}

*After reading the article, complete the following:*

Take a few moments to read through the chapter; towards the end of the letter to students you will find a section titled **"Ten Big Ideas."** Take some time to carefully read through this section again- identify which of those "big ideas" are particularly significant (from your perspective).

Next, consider the following quote:

**We fail to examine our assumptions**.

While many of us may not think that *"we are the center of the universe,"* this Learning Activity provides an opportunity to reflect on some of our own assumptions. For this reflection, consider the following guiding questions:

1. How much of your daily routine, thoughts and habits focus on YOU?
2. What do you think about (daily)?
3. What do I do that is all about ME?

*Be prepared to share your thoughts with the rest of class during the Learning Lab.*

:::

## What is Culture?

Several sources will be used to learn and reinforce the fundamental ideas about culture. This section has several important terms and concepts. You will learn about the characteristics of culture and also learn about cultural universals versus cultural relativism, and about ethnocentrism which influences how you see yourself and others.

We will cycle through the ideas of Culture with three rounds. First an introductory exposure to the study of culture, then aim to gain perspective through a classic article about Americans and a modern perspective on a Western pastime, golf. The third round of readings and embedded videos will revisit some concepts you’ve already been introduced to, and add important new ideas. The material covered in this unit provides the fundamental concepts, and therefore, we will cycle through some terms or concepts more than once.  

::: {.callout-note}
#### Critical Thinking Question {-} 
*Why is ethnocentrism the major obstacle to the understanding of other cultures? How might it be overcome?*

<!-- #### **Read** {-} -->

At this point, you will revisit some ideas you have learned about, and also add a few more new concepts to your understanding of culture. 

- **Read** [**Understanding Culture**](https://humangeography.pressbooks.com/chapter/understanding-culture/){target="_blank"} from the beginning, and finish just before the section titled *"Culture Change."*"

The chapter includes a video on *Symbols, Values, and Norms*, and a second one on *Cultures, Sub-Cultures and Counter-Culture*. End at that point. You do not need to read the *Cultural Change* section we will pick that idea up at the very end of the course.

### Learning Lab Information {-}

Welcome to the first Learning Lab of the course. Each week, it is expected that students attend, and actively engage in a Learning Lab. For this course, the structure and expectations of this time will vary. During this time, however, students will be engaging with their Instructor and/or their Facilitator- they will be leading the session and providing guidance. Additionally this time provides an opportunity for students to seek support or ask questions about any of the elements of the course.

It is expected that students preview the **Learning Lab** section of each unit ***prior*** to attending this session. Often their are readings or activities that you will need to complete in order to prepare for this component of the course. It is also important to note any guiding questions from the Learning Activities embedded throughout each topic- your Facilitator will also be using this time to review the themes from these activities. It is important to review each so that you are prepared to engage with the rest of the group.

{--For most Learning Lab sessions, students will earn marks towards their "Participation" grade for the course. However, some of the Learning Labs will require students to formally present their ideas and research- this will count towards the "Activities" component of your final grade.--}

Be sure to carefully read through the instructions for the Learning Lab each week and organize your time accordingly.

### Learning Lab: Talking to Strangers {-}

We begin our first Learning Lab with a challenge: talking to strangers! As you have learned in this unit, anthropology involves exploring the lives and cultures of others. Based on that exploration, we can develop an understanding of how people live and what things make them unique.

***To begin this activity,*** follow the link below. Here you will find instructions for this challenge.

[**Talking to Strangers**](https://anth101.com/challenge1/){-}

Once you have completed the challenge, you will be asked to share your experience. Use the guidelines provided on the link to prepare your thoughts.

During the set time for the Unit 1 Learning Lab, students will be expected to share their thoughts and ideas from their experience during this *challenge.* Your Facilitator will be guiding the conversation but will be expecting each of you to engage and contribute to the conversation.

As noted above, some time during this Learning Lab will also be set aside so that you can ask any questions you have about the course. Your Facilitator will also be taking some time to review some general information and expectations for the course.

In addition to the activity above, each student should be prepared to discuss the readings and activities found throughout Unit 1. The Instructor and/or Facilitator will be using the Learning Lab to explore these resources.

::: {.callout-caution}

**Note:** *Students will be assessed, during Learning Labs, based on the* ***"Participation"*** *criteria. This criteria can be found under the* **Assignment** *tab at the top of the page. It is important to review this information prior to the Learning Lab.*

## Assessment {-}

::: {.callout-tip}
Students are not responsible for submitting any assignments for grading in Unit 1. Please note, however, that **the content of Unit 1 will be assessed as part of the test you will take at the end of Unit 2.** It is strongly recommended that students review the content from Unit 1 to prepare for this assessment. One way to do that is to use the blank outlines provided on this page and try to reproduce the full outline without looking at your notes or the readings. Once you have finished that, then compare to your completed notes and the readings to will see what you need to review. Repeat this process before your exam, and/or as many times as you need to.
:::

## Checking your Learning {-}

::: {.callout-important}
Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the unit learning outcomes below to see if you are able to do the following:

- Define *culture* and the six characteristics of culture.  
- Discuss *ethnocentrism* and the role it played in early attempts to understand other cultures.  
- Explain how the perspectives of *holism*, *cultural relativism*, *comparison*, and *fieldwork*, as well as both *scientific* and *humanistic* tendencies make anthropology a unique discipline.  
- Evaluate the ways in which anthropology can be used to address current *social*, *political*, and *economic* issues.  

Feel free to review topics more in depth or continue on to the next unit.
