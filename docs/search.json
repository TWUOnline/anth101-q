    "text": "Overview\nWelcome to ANTH 101!\nI have chosen two textbooks for this course. One that introduces you to a wide range of topics through a systematic, descriptive approach. However, you will notice that we do not cover all topics nor all chapters – there simply are too many. I have selected instead, the most common topics that will expose you to how contemporary people across the world live their lives differently than how you live yours. That textbook, called Perspectives, fittingly has numerous authors for the different chapters. However, I will refer to this resource as Perspectives rather than by the individual names of authors for each chapter.\nThe second textbook called The Art of Being Human is limited in scope and topics, but it takes you on a journey of discovery. The author, Michael Wesch, asks questions, and challenges you to find answers. He is masterful in working with core themes, which he presents as videos and challenges for you to do yourself. The New York Times recognized Wesch as an innovative teacher who “give(s) students an experience that might change how they think, what they care about or even how they live their lives” (p. 359).\nHere are a couple of quotes that introduce you to the experience you are about to have through this course:\nWesch talks about being stretched himself – and he challenges you to be stretched – and become a healthy and responsible individual who can create a healthy and responsible society. If each of us does that, we collectively can create a healthier more inclusive and humane world. The fundamental experience of this textbook and the challenges through The Art of Being Human, is summarized this way:",

This course is solely a study of one sub-field: cultural anthropology. We will not study the other sub-fields which are archaeology, biological anthropology and linguistic anthropology. All four sub-fields are “applied” meaning that applied anthropologists span the subfields and use anthropological methods, and findings to solve practical problems in public and private sectors such as business and health.",

It is a science in its systematic approach. It is an art in that individuals are unique in their experience of their humanity. Michael Wesch, the author of your second textbook, shares “what the science of human beings can tell us about the art of being human.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified.

Take some time to explore this material; it will be discussed during the Learning Lab and will play an important role in course assessments.\n\n\nIn order to build a foundational understanding of anthropology, it is important that we first understand why anthropology is important. The readings provided below are intended to guide your exploration of anthropology. When reading chapters in the textbooks, the chapters should be read in their entirety, unless you are instructed that you can omit certain sections.

Omit the brief history and sub-fields section. Read all other sections, including the “Applied Anthropology” section (pp 13-14) and “Why is anthropology important?” (p 17). Reading the illustrations of anthropologists at work is optional.\nNote: Reading chapters from either of the two textbooks provides the foundation and content to the course topics. Understanding of this will be tested in 4 Unit tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\n\n\nTo build upon the first reading, this article offers additional context around the importance of anthropology:\n\nRead: Art of Being Human- Introduction\n\n\nReflect\nAfter reading the article, complete the following:\nTake a few moments to read through the chapter; towards the end of the letter to students you will find a section titled “Ten Big Ideas.” Take some time to carefully read through this section again- identify which of those “big ideas” are particularly significant (from your perspective).\nNext, consider the following quote:\nWe fail to examine our assumptions.\nWhile many of us may not think that “we are the center of the universe,” this Learning Activity provides an opportunity to reflect on some of our own assumptions. For this reflection, consider the following guiding questions:\n\nHow much of your daily routine, thoughts and habits focus on YOU?\nWhat do you think about (daily)?\nWhat do I do that is all about ME?\n\nBe prepared to share your thoughts with the rest of class during the Learning Lab.",

You will learn about the characteristics of culture and also learn about cultural universals versus cultural relativism, and about ethnocentrism which influences how you see yourself and others.\nWe will cycle through the ideas of Culture with three rounds. First an introductory exposure to the study of culture, then aim to gain perspective through a classic article about Americans and a modern perspective on a Western pastime, golf.

Each week, it is expected that students attend, and actively engage in a Learning Lab. For this course, the structure and expectations of this time will vary. During this time, however, students will be engaging with their Instructor and/or their Facilitator- they will be leading the session and providing guidance. Additionally this time provides an opportunity for students to seek support or ask questions about any of the elements of the course.\nIt is expected that students preview the Learning Lab section of each unit prior to attending this session. Often their are readings or activities that you will need to complete in order to prepare for this component of the course. It is also important to note any guiding questions from the Learning Activities embedded throughout each topic- your Facilitator will also be using this time to review the themes from these activities. It is important to review each so that you are prepared to engage with the rest of the group.\n{–For most Learning Lab sessions, students will earn marks towards their “Participation” grade for the course. However, some of the Learning Labs will require students to formally present their ideas and research- this will count towards the “Activities” component of your final grade.–}\nBe sure to carefully read through the instructions for the Learning Lab each week and organize your time accordingly.\n\n\nLearning Lab: Talking to Strangers\nWe begin our first Learning Lab with a challenge: talking to strangers! As you have learned in this unit, anthropology involves exploring the lives and cultures of others. Based on that exploration, we can develop an understanding of how people live and what things make them unique.\nTo begin this activity, follow the link below. Here you will find instructions for this challenge.\nTalking to Strangers\nOnce you have completed the challenge, you will be asked to share your experience. Use the guidelines provided on the link to prepare your thoughts.\nDuring the set time for the Unit 1 Learning Lab, students will be expected to share their thoughts and ideas from their experience during this challenge. Your Facilitator will be guiding the conversation but will be expecting each of you to engage and contribute to the conversation.\nAs noted above, some time during this Learning Lab will also be set aside so that you can ask any questions you have about the course. Your Facilitator will also be taking some time to review some general information and expectations for the course.\nIn addition to the activity above, each student should be prepared to discuss the readings and activities found throughout Unit 1. The Instructor and/or Facilitator will be using the Learning Lab to explore these resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote: Students will be assessed, during Learning Labs, based on the “Participation” criteria. This criteria can be found under the Assignment tab at the top of the page. It is important to review this information prior to the Learning Lab.",

Unit 2 will continue to build on your understanding of culture by focusing on how to do research in Cultural Anthropology and that involves: Talking to strangers!\nFor any of you who have been in a situation where you meet someone new (a stranger), you will know how challenging it can be to establish rapport - typically this is done with “small talk” (also known as relationship building). As an Anthropologist, we might (or might not) be interested in relationship-building, but this vital step is critical for something we are VERY interested in: discovering answers to BIG questions. Without the ability, and skills, to build rapport with strangers, it is very difficult to get a relationship to a place where we can ask the bigger questions we really seek answers to. It is important to remember then, that the more you connect with others, that is, deeply connect with others, the more you will discover the differences that “represent [a] vast range of human potential and possibility” (Wesch, p. 27).\nThis unit will prepare you to start exploring the world….",

We will begin with the topic of perception: how we see.\nIn Unit 1, you were introduced to the works of Wesch in his quest for answers to important questions. Throughout the course I will often refer to his words as he articulately captures some of the big ideas we are exploring in this course. In this unit, we will introduce some more of his thoughts in his approach to fieldwork. Wesch says:\nWe can respond to human differences with hate or ignorance, or we can choose to open up to them and ask questions we have never considered before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\n\nOur exploration of fieldwork requires developing our skill of awareness. To begin, turn your attention to:\n\nAsking Questions, Making Connections, and Trying New Things\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote: Although you are directed to a specific page, please feel free to explore the rest of the site as it can offer many resources, and challenges, to help support your learning.\nHere, we learn about the Art of Seeing:\n\nSeeing our own Seeing to work past our assumptions.\nSeeing Big using complex models of culture.\nSeeing Small and noticing how the little things matter\n\nAnd putting it all together to “See it all” using the holistic perspective.",

    "text": "4.3 Fieldwork – How to Study Culture\nWe now turn our focus to read about other’s experiences in their endeavors to learn about others. Once again, our study will turn to Nacirema as we learn how traditional approaches differ from the approaches we use today. While anthropologists make choices as to the techniques they use, they are duty-bound to give ethical consideration to every study. A fundamental guideline for all Anthropologists is “Do no Harm.”\nBelow, you will explore culture through two activities. One activity will be etic: you as an observer; the other activity will be emic: you as a participant.\n\n\nResources\nThe resources below will help you better understand the content explored in this unit. Take some time to explore this material - it will be discussed during the Learning Lab and will play an important role in course assessments.\n\n\nActivity: Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading #1\n\n\n\nWe now turn our attention to expanding our understanding of culture. We begin by following the link below:\n\nNOBA - Culture\n\nPay special attention to the “Social Psychology Research Methods” section, and note the difference between ethnographic study and cross-cultural research methods (Table 1).\nAlso, take a moment to reflect on how self is understood (situational identity) and valued differently in individualist and collectivistic cultures (Table 3). I also invite you to take a few moments to consider how cultural relativism and ethnocentrism lead us to value self and others differently (cultural intelligence).\n\nReading #2\nNext, we turn our attention to reinforcing our understanding of fieldwork.

This assignment can be found by selecting the “Assessment” tab for Unit 2.\nAs we come to the end the end of Unit 2, your facilitator will help organize groups for this unit’s Learning Lab. Once you have joined a group, your task is to select, and discuss, ONE of the following questions about culture change. Please note, you will be asked to share your thoughts with the rest of the group at the end.\n\nEthnotourism (people travelling to visit and experience Indigenous cultures and societies) is becoming more popular. While it offers economic opportunities, it is also changing these cultures. How might a small-scale culture be affected, and how might an anthropologist work with them to adjust to changes brought about by tourism?\n\nDishwashers are not common in Japanese homes. If you were tasked with marketing dishwashers in Japan how would conduct the research?\n\nHow might the introduction of computers in a small-scale society change people’s ideas attitudes and behaviours?\n\nIf you were working with an Indigenous people in rural India to improve irrigation, what questions would you ask?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote: Students will be assessed during Learning Labs based on the “Participation” criteria. This criteria can be found under the Assignment tab at the top of the page - it is important to review this information prior to the Learning Lab.\n\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead…\nAlthough your Facilitator will mention this to you, please take some time to look ahead to Unit 5 as you will have a major assessment involving a Case Study. While it might be premature to begin that assignment now, it is certainly a good time to start thinking about it.\nBelow are a few resources to help with this process. For now, the goal is to expose you to two similar yet different indigenous cultures: the Maori of New Zealand, and the Aborigines of Australia.\nAs you watch this videos, be observant! I would encourage you to watch these short clips several times to capture the details of the environment, the things that are said (and how they are said), and relationships – self to the physical world, the social world, and the spiritual world.",

    "text": "Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for two graded assessments during this unit. The first assignment, the Ethnography Challenge - Activity #1, is outlined below - this assignment will be presented as part of this unit’s Learning Lab.\nAdditionally, students are responsible for taking Unit Test #1. This test will assess your understanding of content from Units 1 & 2.\n\n\n\nEthnography Challenge - Activity #1\nUnit 2 presents your first formal assessment. This will involve participating in an activity that focuses on ethnography. Your task, for this Challenge, will be to gather your own cultural material in the form of pictures or videos so that they can be used for interpretation - by you and others!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nPlease Note: Part of this assignment (the Discussion) will be shared during your Learning Lab!\n\n\n\n\nTo Begin\nBelow, you will find a link that outlines this Challenge. Take a moment to carefully read through the instructions. Additionally, you will also find some examples of what materials could look like.\nClick on the link below to begin:\nFieldwork of the Familiar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nImportant We will not be expecting students to post their pictures on Instagram (or any other social media platform). Instead, this step is to prepare for our Learning Lab where you will be sharing your pictures with the group so that we can respect everyone’s privacy from the public - these materials will, however be uploaded to the assignment dropbox found at the bottom of this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext…\nNow that you have read through an outline of this activity, it is expected that each student will bring four or five photos to share with class - these will be shared during the Learning Lab for Unit 2.\nTIP for sharing your photos - Do not distort your picture if you paste it to a PPT slide or a Word document. You may crop a picture but you should not stretch it in any one direction. It should always look as it was when you took the picture. In MS Word or PPT, you can select ‘Lock Aspect Ratio’ when resizing.\nBy this point in the course, you have learned how important detail is to an Anthropologist - for this reason, it is important that you are very, very descriptive. As part of your presentation, each student must create a list of at least 20 descriptive words or phrases that describe elements/components of your photos - these will be shared with the class.\nAs part of developing these descriptions, consider the following guiding questions:\n\nIs there a prominent use of a particular color or colors?\n\nDoes quantity or size appear to be emphasized?\nIs there a lot of variety within one domain (an area of focus)?\n\nAre things simple or complex and detailed?\n\nDo you see conformity in behaviors? What things appear to be the same? What is everyone doing, or wearing, etc…?\n\n\n\n\nFinally…\nFollowing the Learning Lab, it is expected that you will upload your favorite photo to the dropbox provided (i.e their one favorite photo).\nAs part of this submission, students MUST include a caption. Again, consider how important descriptive language is to an anthropologist - get creative!\nOnce this step has been completed, upload your photo and caption to the Ethnography Challenge - Activity #1 dropbox.\nHere are the grading criteria that will be used to assess your submission:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment Criteria\n%\n\n\n\n\nMeaningfulness\nEvidence of meaningful thought put into searching out, and seeing the “unfamiliar.”\n1\n\n\nQuality of Data\nThe picture is meaningful in the sense that it was chosen to document cultural features in a meaningful manner that is intentional in its focus of the subject matter.\n1\n\n\nCreativity of Images\nImage composition demonstrates creativity in some form (e.g. use of light, color, perspective, etc…)\n1\n\n\nDiscussion\nYour oral description of your pictures should be accurate, rich and vivid. Also, clearly explain your field experience.\n1\n\n\n\nThis activity will represent 4% of your overall grade for the course - your Facilitator will be grading this assessment",

Topics in this unit intersect with every other topic of anthropology, and the ways of getting or producing food, and ways of distributing and consuming products have wide-ranging implications. You will be introduced to some of the most unique cultures of the world, cultures whose way of life starkly contrasts with your own.

You will be reading two chapters from the Perspectives text that will give you systematic information about how small-scale societies forage (gather plants and hunt or fish).We will also learn about how increasing complexity, and favorable environmental conditions, have allowed societies to become horticulturalist (farmers) or pastoralists (herders). Ultimately, an important objective of this section is to introduce you (through video clips) to lifeways that are very different than your own.\nAs humans use the environment, they also affect it. That impact can be degrading to the environment, and can threaten small people groups whose existence is dependent on a fragile environment. To better understand this crisis, you will explore some resources that advocate for the survival of indigenous peoples.\n\n\nResources\nThe resources below will help you better understand the content explored in this unit.

    "text": "5.2 Economics\nThis focus of this Topic aligns with Chapter 6 in your Perspectives textbook. This chapter introduces you to the three distinct phases of economic activity: production, exchange, and consumption. Production involves transforming nature and what it produces into the material goods we need, or want. That transformational process involves having knowledge, skills, and tools with which to make products that will be distributed and eventually consumed.\nChapter 6 also presents two interesting case studies: One on Fair Trade coffee (Guatemala); and another on Darjeeling tea (India). Your professor, Dr. Anaya, has spent 20 years going to coffee farms in Guatemala every year with the objective of having students learn about agricultural trade commodities and international development. Many students are motivated by social justice, which can be partly understood through studying Fair Trade. The objective of Fair Trade, is to achieve sustainable and equitable trade relations.

In this chapter, you will be introduced to a lot of new terminology. You do not need to memorize every term in the chapter glossary, but you should be able to work with terminology and understand that the same term can mean different things in different cultures, (e.g. who is ‘mother’) and the same relationship can have different terms (e.g. a female marriage partner can be a first or third wife, or a widow or be re-married to her deceased husband’s brother).\nWe begin with a more in-depth study with the resources below….\n\nResources\nThe resources below will help you better understand the content explored in this unit.

    "section": "6.2 Marriage and Family",
    "text": "6.2 Marriage and Family\nWe next shift our focus to exploring cultural norms about marriage and family. Below, this topic will be studied using several videos showing uncommon practices. Some ideologies and practices are unique to small and isolated people groups (e.g. marriage among the Na people living in the foothills of the Himalayas (Perspectives, 2020, p. 254)). Other perspectives, however, are not universal, but are global in that they are found in societies around the world - especially nowadays due to migration transferring traditional practices into modern cities (e.g. female genital mutilation). Some gender practices are harmful and have been addressed by advocacy groups. Examples of these include child marriage, dowry deaths, and honor killings. Many of these practices that you will learn about, are changing due to the influence of globalization, as members of their communities are exposed to contrasting outsider practices.\nWe begin with our resources below:\n\nTopic 2 Resources\nThe resources below will help you better understand the content explored in this unit. Take some time to explore this material - it will be discussed during the Learning Lab and will play an important role in course assessments.\nWe begin with resources that tell stories of how love and relationships are seen in societal structures around the world. Most of the practices you will watch and read about may not be practiced in your country or ethno-cultural group; however, they are still practiced to a greater or lesser extent, depending on country laws and changing cultural patterns. Many of these practices are changing due to global objections and the work of advocacy groups that fight for the basic Human Rights of dignity and equality of all persons.\nThe first video you are to watch is about child brides in India, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nepal and Ethiopia. Very often child brides are not the only wife, they may be the first or last wife in a polygamous marriage. The next video shows you what polygamy looks like in Togo, West Africa.\nThe article “Love in Four Cultures” illustrates how love is experienced in Papua New Guinea, in a Masai boarding school in Kenya, in a village in South India, and in Scotland. Sometimes, marriages are not built on love, but on family agreements that require a dowry or payment to either the bride’s family or groom’s family. Some dowry practices are harmful and may even be unethical or illegal, as you will see in the last video filmed in Bangladesh and India.\nWith each of these practices, it is likely that there are stark differences to how your family expresses love, and observes marriage and family customs. Note that these practices need to be understood before they are criticized. Your purpose here should be to understand the practice, and why and how it is practiced.\n\n\nActivity Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch and Reflect\n\n\n\nWe begin our study of marriage practices around the world by watching a video on The Secret World of Child Brides. Every year, throughout the world, millions of young girls are forced into marriage. Child marriage is outlawed in many countries, and international agreements forbid the practice, yet this tradition still spans continents, language, religion, and caste.\nThis multi-media presentation reveals child marriage practices in India, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nepal and Ethiopia. It is important for you to be informed about the difficult experiences child brides face. Read the notes under the video to learn about how you can get involved in taking action against this practice.\n\n\n\n\nOver an eight-year period, photographer Stephanie Sinclair has investigated the phenomenon of child marriage in India, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nepal and Ethiopia. Her multimedia presentation, produced in association with National Geographic, synthesizes this body of work into a call to action.\nStephanie Sinclair’s images are featured in a story on child marriage in the June 2011 issue of National Geographic magazine.\nHow to help: National Geographic has compiled a list of organizations that encourage families to delay marriage and give girls an opportunity to reach their full potential.\nIn a related post Stephanie Sinclair shares the difficult experiences child brides face. She discusses the need for their voices to be heard and the challenges she faced as a journalist who witnessed their struggles and abuse.\nTo learn more, follow the link:\n\nToo Young to Wed\n\nThis next video shifts focus to the idea of polygamy as a practice of marriage. It features a Muslim tribe in Togo, West Africa, that practices polygamy. For them, another wife means another set of hands to do the work…:\n\nMultiple Marriage\nNext, we explore the opposite of polygamy: polyandry. Here, we are introduced to one group of people in the Himalayas that practices the lifestyle of a woman having multiple husbands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading\nOur focus now turns to a reading by Wesch on Love in the Four Cultures. As you read, reflect on the role of love, passion, choice, and commitment play in marriage in the four different cultures. Love in Four Cultures\n\n\nWatch and Reflect\nOur last resources for this section looks at an ancient marriage custom called “paying dowry.” Paying dowry is an ancient marriage custom whereby money and goods are transferred from a woman’s family to her new husband’s family. While it is officially banned in Bangladesh and India, there still is a demand for this type of economic advantage. For women, it often leads to a life of suffering, even torture and death. As you watch, Reflect on how you can take action against family violence.",
